**Activity 1: The "Full Practice SAC Simulation & Deconstruction"
This is the most direct practice of the SAC task.
How to do it:
1.
Source Practice Questions & Stimuli: Obtain practice SAC questions or extended response questions that include multiple sources (stimuli) related to Unit 3 AOS 1 content. These can come from your textbook, practice SAC packs, past VCAA exams (be mindful of study design changes, but the skill is transferable), or resources like ATAR Notes or Health Resources Hub materials. Ensure the stimuli are varied (data, text excerpts, images, case studies).
2.
Set the Scene: Simulate SAC conditions as much as possible (timed, limited resources). For a 50-mark SAC, this might be around 1 hour 45 minutes, potentially split into annotation/planning and writing.
3.
Active Question Deconstruction: Before looking at sources, read the question carefully. Actively break it down by highlighting or underlining command words (analyse, discuss, explain, evaluate, justify), key concepts (health status, burden of disease, specific factors, population groups, models of health), and explicit requirements (e.g., "using information from sources A, B, and C," "using your own knowledge," "analyse two factors"). Create a checklist of everything the response must include.
4.
Active Stimuli Annotation & Linking: Read each source. Actively annotate it. Circle or highlight information relevant to your question checklist. Use different colours for different checklist items if it helps. Crucially, write notes on the stimuli or a separate planning sheet showing explicit links you see:
◦
Between Source A and Source B (e.g., "Source B's explanation aligns with the trend shown in Source A's data").
◦
Between a source and your own knowledge (e.g., "Source C mentions SES, which links to my knowledge of how income impacts access to healthcare").
◦
Between sources and the question's requirements (e.g., "Source D provides data on life expectancy, which is a key health status indicator required by the question")..
5.
Active Planning (Synthesis Focus): Use your deconstructed question and annotated sources to create a detailed response plan. This is where synthesis happens on paper. For each planned paragraph (using a structure like TEEL), note:
◦
The main point (Topic Sentence).
◦
Which specific information from which sources you will use as evidence (e.g., "Source A, para 2; Source C, Figure 1"). Explicitly plan to use multiple sources together if they relate.
◦
How you will use your own knowledge to explain, elaborate on, or link the source information to HHD concepts and the question. Plan how you will explain the relationship between the source info and your own knowledge/the question.
◦
How you will link back to the question.
◦
Ensure your plan explicitly incorporates the relationships you identified in step 4.
6.
Write the Response: Write your extended response, following your detailed plan. Focus on clear language, accurate HHD terminology, and seamlessly integrating information from sources (citing them) and your own knowledge.
7.
Active Review & Refine: After writing, go back to your checklist from step 3. Did you include everything? Read through your response specifically looking for where you used sources, where you used your own knowledge, and critically assess if you demonstrated synthesis – did you just mention sources, or did you weave them together and use your knowledge to explain why the information matters in relation to the question?. Identify areas for improvement.

**Activity 2: The "Stimuli Relationship Mapping" Sprint
This activity isolates and focuses specifically on the crucial analysis and synthesis step.
How to do it:
1.
Gather Stimuli & Question: Use the same types of materials as Activity 1, but perhaps focus on shorter sets (e.g., 2-3 sources) and a specific section of a question.
2.
Focus on Relationships: Give yourself a shorter time limit (e.g., 20-30 minutes). Your only task is to read the question and stimuli and map out the relationships between them.
3.
Visual Mapping: Use a large sheet of paper or a digital tool. Draw the question in the centre. Draw each source around it. Draw lines connecting:
◦
Sources to the question (indicating what information from that source is relevant to which part of the question).
◦
Sources to other sources (indicating connections or contrasts in information).
◦
Sources to relevant areas of your own knowledge (e.g., "Source A [data] -> My Knowledge [definition of the indicator, relevant factor theory]").
◦
Write brief notes on the lines or next to the sources/knowledge points explaining the nature of the relationship (e.g., "Source B explains why data in Source A looks like this").
4.
Verbal Explanation: After mapping, verbally explain the map to yourself, a study partner, or even record it. Articulate how the sources relate to each other and the question, and how your own knowledge fits in. This reinforces the synthesis thinking process.

**Activity 3: The "Factor-Condition-Population Link Chain"
This activity helps solidify the links between factors, specific health outcomes, and population groups often required in synthesis questions, especially for Unit 3 AOS 1. While not always using stimuli, it builds the foundational knowledge needed to apply to stimuli.
How to do it:
1.
Choose: Select a population group comparison (e.g., Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples vs. non-Indigenous Australians, Males vs. Females, High SES vs. Low SES).
2.
Choose: Select a relevant factor category (Biological, Sociocultural, or Environmental).
3.
Choose: Select a specific health condition or health status indicator that shows variation between the groups.
4.
Build the Chain: Draw or write a step-by-step chain, explaining how the chosen factor contributes to the difference in the health condition/indicator between the two groups. Be specific and use HHD terminology.
◦
Example (incorporating past VCAA examples): Low SES (Sociocultural factor) -> Lower education levels -> Lower health literacy -> Less likely to understand/act on preventative health messages (e.g., around smoking) -> Higher smoking rates -> Increased risk of lung cancer -> Higher mortality from lung cancer -> Contributes to lower life expectancy and higher burden of disease (YLL/DALY) in low SES groups compared to high SES groups.
5.
Practice Variations: Repeat with different factors, conditions, and population groups. Incorporate how these factors might link through dimensions of health and wellbeing as well.
