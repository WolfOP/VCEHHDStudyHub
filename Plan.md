Phased Development Plan
This plan breaks down the website creation into manageable phases, starting with Unit 3.

Phase 1: Foundation & Design (4-6 Weeks)

Goals: Finalize planning, define the visual style, and structure the website.
Tasks:
Detailed Content Audit & Sitemap: Review the "HHD Source Report" and finalize a detailed sitemap for Unit 3 pages. Map content from the report to specific pages.
Wireframing: Create low-fidelity wireframes for key page templates (e.g., homepage, AOS overview page, Key Knowledge page, glossary page, assessment prep page). Focus on layout and information hierarchy.
Visual Design Mockups: Develop high-fidelity mockups based on the wireframes and the "modernist dark profile" aesthetic. Select color palette, typography, and element styles. Ensure mockups are created for desktop and mobile views.
Technology Stack Selection: Decide on the development approach (e.g., static site generator like Hugo/Jekyll, HTML/CSS/JS from scratch, or a simple CMS if content updates need to be very frequent by non-technical users).
Setup Development Environment: Basic project setup, version control (Git).
Phase 2: Unit 3 Core Content Development (8-12 Weeks)

Goals: Build out the main structure and populate all Unit 3 content.
Tasks:
Develop Base Templates: Code the HTML/CSS/JS for the main page templates based on the approved mockups.
Content Population (Unit 3 - AOS 1 & AOS 2):
Create all pages for Unit 3 Key Knowledge and Key Skills.

Integrate text, definitions, examples, and data from the source report.
Create and embed necessary diagrams and tables (e.g., dimensions of health, models of health comparison).
Glossary Development: Create the interactive glossary page and populate it with Unit 3 terms.
Basic Assessment Prep Section: Create pages explaining assessment structure and types for Unit 3.
Implement Responsive Design: Ensure all developed pages are responsive and functional across devices.
Basic SEO: Implement on-page SEO best practices (titles, meta descriptions).
Phase 3: Interactivity & Refinement (Unit 3) (4-6 Weeks)

Goals: Enhance user engagement with interactive elements for Unit 3 and conduct initial testing.
Tasks:
Develop Initial Interactive Elements:
Implement self-check quizzes for key Unit 3 concepts.
Create interactive flashcards for the Unit 3 glossary if not done in Phase 2.
Develop Practice Questions: Add sample practice questions for Unit 3 SACs.
Internal Testing & Review:
Thoroughly review all Unit 3 content for accuracy against the source report and Study Design.
Test website functionality, navigation, and links.
Cross-browser and cross-device testing.
Gather Initial User Feedback (Small Group): If possible, get feedback from a few VCE students or teachers on usability and content clarity for Unit 3.
Iterate based on Feedback: Make necessary adjustments.
Phase 4: Launch Unit 3 & Initial Promotion (1-2 Weeks)

Goals: Deploy the Unit 3 version of the website and make it accessible.
Tasks:
Final Checks & Deployment: Final testing, optimization, and deployment to a web host.
Setup Analytics: Integrate web analytics (e.g., Google Analytics) to track usage.
Initial Promotion: Announce the website to relevant communities (e.g., VCE student forums, teacher networks, if appropriate).
Phase 5: Unit 4 Expansion (8-12 Weeks - Can run parallel to ongoing maintenance of Unit 3)

Goals: Develop and integrate all content and features for Unit 4.
Tasks:
Content Creation & Population (Unit 4): Repeat content development tasks from Phase 2 for Unit 4 AOS 1 and AOS 2.

Extend Glossary: Add Unit 4 specific terms.
Develop Unit 4 Interactive Elements & Practice Questions.
Integrate Unit 4 into Navigation and Site Structure.
Testing and Review for Unit 4 Content.
Phase 6: Ongoing Maintenance, Full Launch & Future Enhancements (Ongoing)

Goals: Ensure the website remains up-to-date, functional, and continues to meet student needs.
Tasks:
Monitor Analytics and User Feedback: Continuously gather feedback for improvements.
Content Updates: Keep content aligned with any minor Study Design updates or new insights.
Bug Fixing and Performance Optimization.
Phased Rollout of Advanced Features: (e.g., more sophisticated interactive tools, user accounts, forums â€“ as per "Future Considerations" in PRD).
