            <h1>Assessment Preparation</h1>
            <p>Understanding how you'll be assessed is key to success in VCE Health and Human Development. This section provides an overview of the assessment structure for Unit 3 and general tips for preparing for SACs and the end-of-year examination.</p>

            <h2>VCE HHD Assessment Overview</h2>
            <p>Your final study score for VCE Health and Human Development is determined by a combination of School-Assessed Coursework (SACs) and an external end-of-year examination.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unit 3 School-Assessed Coursework (SACs):</strong> Contributes 25% to your final study score.</li>
                <li><strong>Unit 4 School-Assessed Coursework (SACs):</strong> Contributes 25% to your final study score.</li>
                <li><strong>End-of-Year Examination (covers Units 3 & 4):</strong> Contributes 50% to your final study score.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To receive a study score, students must achieve an 'S' (Satisfactory) for both Units 3 and 4.</p>

            <h2>Unit 3 School-Assessed Coursework (SACs)</h2>
            <p>For Unit 3, "Australia's health in a globalised world," your performance on two outcomes will be assessed through SACs. Each outcome is typically allocated 50 marks, contributing to a total of 100 marks for the Unit 3 SACs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Outcome 1 (Understanding health and wellbeing):</strong> On completion, students should be able to explain the complex, dynamic, and global nature of health and wellbeing, interpret and apply Australia's health status data, and analyse variations in health status.</li>
                <li><strong>Outcome 2 (Promoting health in Australia):</strong> On completion, students should be able to explain changes to public health approaches, analyse improvements in population health over time, and evaluate health promotion strategies and initiatives.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>SAC tasks are school-based and must be part of your regular teaching program, completed mainly in class within a limited timeframe. Work submitted must be your own.</p>

            <h4>Suitable SAC Tasks for Unit 3:</h4>
            <p>Your school will select tasks from the following list. Each task type can generally only be selected once across Outcome 1 and Outcome 2 in Unit 3.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A written report (e.g., media analysis, research investigation, blog post, case study analysis).</li>
                <li>An extended response question analysing various stimuli (text, data, visuals).</li>
                <li>An oral presentation (e.g., debate, podcast).</li>
                <li>A visual presentation (e.g., concept map, annotated poster, digital presentation).</li>
                <li>Structured questions (including data analysis or case study analysis).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>(Specific details about your school's SAC tasks will be provided by your teacher.)</em></p>

            <h2>General Exam Preparation (Units 3 & 4)</h2>
            <p>The end-of-year examination is 2 hours long and assesses all Key Knowledge and Key Skills from both Unit 3 and Unit 4.</p>
            <h4>Key Tips for Preparation:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Understand Command Words:</strong> Know what's expected for terms like 'explain', 'analyse', 'evaluate', 'discuss', 'identify', 'describe'.</li>
                <li><strong>Master Key Knowledge:</strong> Thoroughly review all content from the Study Design.</li>
                <li><strong>Practice Key Skills:</strong> Regularly practice applying your knowledge to different scenarios, data, and question types.</li>
