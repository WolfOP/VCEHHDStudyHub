Product Requirement Document (PRD): VCE HHD Study Website
1. Introduction

Product: An educational website providing comprehensive study materials, resources, and practice tools for students undertaking the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) Health and Human Development (HHD) subject, specifically focusing on the 2025-2029 Study Design.
Initial Focus: Unit 3: "Australia's health in a globalised world".

Future Expansion: Unit 4: "Health and human development in a global context".

Purpose: To enhance student understanding of key HHD concepts, develop essential skills, and provide effective preparation for School-Assessed Coursework (SACs) and the end-of-year examination.
Design Inspiration: A modern, minimalist aesthetic with a dark profile, similar to the provided "Better Stack" website image, emphasizing clarity, readability, and user engagement.
2. Goals and Objectives

To provide accurate, VCAA Study Design-aligned content for VCE HHD Unit 3 (and subsequently Unit 4).
To simplify complex HHD concepts through clear explanations, examples, and visual aids.
To offer diverse learning tools, including text, diagrams, interactive elements, and practice assessments.
To create an intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing online study environment.
To help students build confidence and achieve success in their HHD studies.
3. Target Audience

Primary: VCE students currently studying or planning to study Health and Human Development (Years 11 & 12), aligned with the 2025-2029 Study Design.
Secondary: VCE HHD teachers looking for supplementary resources for their students.

5. Non-Functional Requirements

NF1. User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX):
NF1.1. Visual Design: Modernist, clean, minimalist look with a dark theme (deep greys/charcoal, not pure black for readability) and light text. Use accent colors (e.g., a vibrant color like purple or teal from the example) sparingly for interactive elements and calls to action.
NF1.2. Typography: Clear, legible sans-serif fonts for body text and headings. Good typographic hierarchy.
NF1.3. Layout: Uncluttered, with generous use of "dark space." Content should be well-organized and easy to scan.

NF4. Maintainability:
NF4.1. Content should be relatively easy to update, especially for adding Unit 4 or new resources. (Consider a static site generator or a simple CMS if feasible).
NF5. Accuracy & Reliability:
NF5.1. All content must be accurate and rigorously aligned with the VCE HHD Study Design (2025-2029) and the provided source report.
NF5.2. Citations from the source report should be managed or information appropriately attributed if necessary for internal tracking or verification.
6. Content Requirements (Summary)

All Key Knowledge and Key Skills for Unit 3 AOS 1 and AOS 2.
