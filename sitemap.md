This detailed sitemap and content map should guide the creation of the Unit 3 section. Each "Page/Section" above would ideally translate to a distinct, scrollable segment within the Unit3Component or, if very long, could be further broken down into sub-navigation if needed (though for an SPA, long scrolling pages are common).
