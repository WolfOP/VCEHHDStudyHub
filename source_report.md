Okay, let's compile a source report for Unit 3 of the VCE Health and Human Development study, drawing on the information provided in the sources. 

**VCE Health and Human Development: Unit 3 – Australia’s health in a globalised world** 

Unit 3 is titled "Australia’s health in a globalised world". In this unit, students examine health and wellbeing, disease, and illness, understanding them as **multidimensional, dynamic, and subject to different interpretations and contexts**. The unit explores health and wellbeing as a global concept and highlights its importance as **an individual and a collective resource**. Students will analyse and evaluate **variations in the health status of Australians**. A significant focus is on **health promotion** and the improvements seen in population health over time. Students will investigate various public health approaches, such as the "old" public health, the biomedical approach, the social model of health, and the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion, and the interdependence of these models. While the primary emphasis is on the Australian health system, these public health changes and influences should be viewed within a global context. 

The study is made up of four units, and Unit 3 is one of them. Unit 3 is structured into **two Areas of Study**. Each Area of Study contains specific content designed to enable students to achieve a defined outcome for the unit. Each outcome is described in terms of key knowledge and key skills. 

**Areas of Study in Unit 3:** 

1. **Area of Study 1: Understanding health and wellbeing**: This area delves into health and wellbeing and illness as **complex, dynamic, and subjective concepts**. Students consider global public health goals and the increasing impact of global conditions on Australians. A key part of this area is developing an understanding of the **indicators used to measure and evaluate health status** and the factors contributing to variations in health status among different population groups. 
1. **Area of Study 2: Promoting health in Australia**: This area examines **different approaches to public health** throughout history, focusing on changes and successful strategies that have improved health outcomes. Students will look at the progression of public health in Australia since 1900, including influences like the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion and the shift towards focusing on population groups, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. Students will investigate the Australian health system and its role in promoting health and wellbeing, applying their knowledge to evaluate health promotion campaigns and programs. 

**Outcomes for Unit 3:** 

- **Outcome 1:** On completion of Area of Study 1, students should be able to explain the complex, dynamic, and global nature of health and wellbeing, interpret and apply Australia’s health status data, and analyse variations in health status. 
- **Outcome 2:** On completion of Area of Study 2, students should be able to explain changes to public health approaches, analyse improvements in population health over time, and evaluate health promotion strategies and initiatives. 

**Key Concepts and Knowledge in Unit 3:** 

- The concepts of **health and wellbeing** (including its five dimensions: physical, social, emotional, mental, and spiritual), illness, and their dynamic and subjective nature. The five dimensions are interrelated. Wellbeing is considered an implicit element of health. 
- The **benefits of optimal health and wellbeing** and its importance as a resource for individuals, the nation, and globally. 
- **Indicators used to measure and understand health status**, including incidence, prevalence, morbidity, **burden of disease** (measured in **DALY**, **YLL**, and **YLD**), life expectancy, Health-Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE), mortality (maternal, infant, and under five), and self-assessed health status. Burden of disease measures the impact of diseases and injuries by quantifying the gap between current health status and an ideal state of living to old age free of disease and disability, using DALYs. DALYs combine Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to premature death and Years Lived with Disability (YLD) due to illness, disease, or injury. 
- The contribution to Australia’s health status from specific factors: **smoking and vaping, alcohol, overweight and obesity, and nutritional imbalance** (e.g., under-consumption of fruits, vegetables, and dairy; high intake of fat, salt, and sugar; low fibre intake). 
- **Biological, sociocultural, and environmental factors** that contribute to variations in health status between population groups such as males and females, Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, those with high and low socioeconomic status, and those living within and outside major cities. 
- Reasons for improvements in Australia's health status since 1900, including the 'old' public health, the biomedical approach, the social model of health, and the **Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion**. 
- The **role of health promotion** in improving population health. 
- Programs aimed at improving the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, and how they promote social justice. 
- Initiatives to promote healthy eating in Australia. 
- Challenges in achieving nutritional change. 
- Australia's health system, including Medicare, private health insurance, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), and the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), and its role in promoting health in terms of funding, sustainability, access, and equity. 

**Assessment in Unit 3:** 

- Awarding **satisfactory completion ('S')** for a unit is based on the teacher's assessment that the student has demonstrated achievement of the set of outcomes specified for that unit. 
- For Units 3 and 4, the **School-assessed Coursework (SAC)** contributes 25% to the final study score. SAC tasks are school-based and must be part of the regular teaching program, completed mainly in class within a limited timeframe. 
- For Unit 3, the student's performance on Outcome 1 and Outcome 2 is assessed through SACs, with each outcome typically allocated 50 marks, contributing to a total of 100 marks for the unit SACs. 
- Suitable tasks for Unit 3 SACs include written reports (media analysis, research investigation, blog post, case study analysis), extended response questions analysing stimuli, oral presentations (debate, podcast), visual presentations (concept map, annotated poster, digital presentation), and structured questions (data analysis, case study analysis). Each task type can be selected only once across the two outcomes. 
- The level of achievement for Units 3 and 4 is also assessed by an **end-of-year external examination**, which contributes 50% to the study score. The exam is 2 hours long and covers all key knowledge and key skills from both Unit 3 and Unit 4.

**Sources,,: Unit 4: Health and human development in a global context** In Unit 4, students examine health and human development in a global context, using data to investigate health status and human development in different countries and exploring factors contributing to inequalities. They consider global trends like climate change, digital technologies, world trade, tourism, conflict, and mass migration. The concept of sustainability is key. 

**Sources,,,,,,,: Unit 4 Area of Study 1: Global health and human development** Outcome 1 involves analyzing similarities and differences in health status and human development globally and analyzing contributing factors. Key knowledge includes the concept of human development, the Human Development Index (HDI) (advantages/limitations), characteristics of low-, middle-, and high-income countries, similarities/differences in health status and human development (including Australia), factors contributing to similarities/differences (access to safe water/sanitation, poverty, inequality, discrimination), the concept/dimensions of sustainability, and implications of global trends. Key skills involve explaining human development/HDI, describing country characteristics, evaluating data, analyzing factors, comparing data/information, explaining sustainability, and analyzing implications of global trends. 

**Sources,,,,,,,,,: Unit 4 Area of Study 2: Health and the Sustainable Development Goals** This area focuses on global health action, the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the WHO, global aid programs, and individual/social action. Outcome 2 involves analyzing the relationships between SDGs and their role in promoting health and human development and evaluating the effectiveness of global aid programs. Key knowledge covers the importance of SDGs, key features of SDG 3 ('Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages'), relationships between SDG 3 and other SDGs (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 12), goals and objectives of the WHO, types/characteristics of aid (bilateral, multilateral, NGO), Australia's aid program (role in supporting SDGs, partnerships), features of effective aid programs, and ways individuals can take action. The Road to Zero initiative is an example applying SDGs, specifically SDG 3. Key skills include discussing SDG importance, describing SDG 3 features, analyzing relationships between SDGs, explaining WHO goals/objectives, analyzing aid effectiveness, discussing Australia's aid program role/partnerships, evaluating aid programs, and discussing ways of taking action. 

**Sources,,,,,,,: Unit 4 Assessment** School-assessed Coursework for Unit 4 contributes 25% to the study score. Outcome 1 and Outcome 2 are each allocated 50 marks. Suitable tasks are the same as for Unit 3 SACs. The end-of-year examination assesses Units 3 and 4 content and contributes 50% to the study score. It is a 2-hour exam. 

**Sources-: VCE Year 11 & 12 Subject Handbook - Vermont Secondary College** This handbook provides information on various VCE subjects offered at Vermont Secondary College, including Health and Human Development. It outlines the structure, outcomes, and assessment tasks for HHD Units 1-4 offered at this school. It reiterates the VCE HHD structure, key concepts, outcomes, and assessment methods consistent with the VCAA study design. It also provides details on other subjects like Science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Psychology), Visual Arts (Art Creative Practices, Media Arts, Visual Communication Design), Commerce (Accounting, Business Management, Economics, Politics, Legal Studies), Computing (Applied Computing, Software Development), English subjects, Health/PE/Outdoor Education (Health and Human Development, Outdoor Education, Physical Education), Humanities (Geography, Ancient History, Modern History, Revolutions History), Languages (French, German), Mathematics (Foundation Mathematics, General Mathematics, Mathematics Methods, Specialist Mathematics), and Music. It also describes the VCE Vocational Major program and VCE VET programs and VCE Higher Education Studies. This source confirms the implementation of the 2025 VCE study design. 

**Source: 5.4 The biomedical approach to health.pdf** This source defines the **biomedical model of health**. Its major characteristics include being a medical model practiced by doctors/health professionals, focusing on **diagnosis, cure, and treatment of disease**, focusing on the individual's health, and centering on the physical/biological aspects of disease/illness. Examples of biomedical interventions include X-rays, antibiotics, blood tests, surgery, and transplants. The source also notes strengths and limitations of this approach. 

**Sources,,: 5.5 Development of the social model of health and the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion.pdf** This source introduces the **social model of health**, which involves policies, education, and health promotion activities. It led to the development of the **Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion**. The Ottawa Charter provides a framework for health promotion strategies and includes five action areas. One action area is **Develop personal skills**, which involves gaining health-related knowledge and skills to make informed decisions (e.g., learning to cook healthy meals). 

**Source: 5.6 The relationship between the Biomedical and social model approach to health.pdf** This source explains how both the **biomedical and social models of health** can be used together to reduce the burden of disease. The biomedical model assists in diagnosing and treating diseases like cardiovascular disease (CVD) with medication or surgery, reducing mortality rates and contributing to reduced burden of disease. 

**Sources,,,,,,,,,: Health Status and Indicators** **Health status** refers to an individual's or population's overall level of health and wellbeing using indicators like life expectancy, mortality, and morbidity. **Health indicators** are standard statistics used to measure and compare health status. Collecting health status data helps identify trends and evaluate 

interventions. Key indicators include mortality (maternal, infant, under five), incidence, prevalence, morbidity, burden of disease (DALY, YLL, YLD), life expectancy, and health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE). Data analysis involves understanding titles, axes, units, and keys to identify trends, similarities, and differences, using specific data values in responses. 

**Sources,,: Burden of Disease, YLL, YLD** **Burden of disease** measures the impact of diseases and injuries, representing the gap between current health status and ideal health. It is measured in **Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY)**. One DALY equals one year of healthy life lost due to premature death (**Years of Life Lost - YLL**) and time lived with illness, disease, or injury (**Years Lived with Disability - YLD**). The formula is **DALY = YLL + YLD**. YLL is the fatal component, and YLD is the non-fatal component. Some conditions contribute more to YLL, while others contribute more to YLD, but all contribute to both. 

**Sources,,,,,,,,,,,,: Sociocultural Factors** Sociocultural factors are a key category influencing health status and variations between population groups. Examples include socioeconomic status (income, occupation, education), unemployment, social isolation, food security, early life experiences, access to healthcare (must be sociocultural discussion), social connections, social exclusion, discrimination (racism). **Social exclusion** can lead to mental health conditions and reduced access to healthcare. **Health literacy** (ability to understand health recommendations/promotion) is influenced by education and impacts health outcomes. These factors can contribute to differences in health status and burden of disease. 

**Sources,,,,,,,,,,,: Biological Factors** Biological factors relate to the body and impact health and wellbeing. Examples include genetics, body weight, blood pressure, blood cholesterol, blood glucose levels, and birth weight. These factors affect the functioning of body systems. High body weight can increase blood pressure, a risk factor for heart attack and stroke. Explaining the impact of a biological factor involves identifying the factor, discussing how it contributes to ill health, and linking it to a dimension of health and wellbeing or a health status indicator. 

**Sources,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,: Concepts and Dimensions of Health and Wellbeing** Health and wellbeing is the overall state of a person's physical, social, emotional, mental, and spiritual existence, characterized by equilibrium and feeling happy, healthy, capable, and engaged. The **WHO definition of health** (1946) defined health as "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity". The **five dimensions** are physical, social, emotional, mental, and spiritual. 

- **Physical health and wellbeing** relates to the body's functioning and systems, including the physical capacity to perform daily activities. It is supported by physical activity, diet, rest, healthy body weight, and absence of illness/injury. 
- **Social health and wellbeing** relates to the ability to form meaningful relationships and manage interactions effectively. Optimal social health includes well-functioning networks, clear communication, managing social settings, developing/maintaining relationships, and positive contributions. 
- **Emotional health and wellbeing** relates to the ability to express feelings positively, manage emotions, and display resilience. It is about the positive management and expression of emotional actions/reactions. 
- **Mental health and wellbeing** is the current state of the mind/brain, relating to the ability to think and process information. It involves positive self-esteem, confidence, optimism, and low levels of stress/anxiety. Emotions are short-term and often have identifiable causes, while moods are milder, longer-lasting, and may have unclear causes. 
- **Spiritual health and wellbeing** is non-material, relating to ideas, beliefs, values, ethics, hope, peace, meaning, value, and reflection on one's place in the world. It can relate to religion, a higher power, morals, values, purpose, connection, and belonging. Finding meaning and purpose in life is related to spiritual health. 

**Sources,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,: Interrelationships between Dimensions** The five dimensions are **interrelated**; a change in one usually affects the others. Demonstrating interrelationships involves showing how the impact on one dimension leads to an impact on another. Examples link different aspects of the dimensions, showing a chain of effects. 

**Sources,,,,,,,,,: Dynamic and Subjective Nature** Health and wellbeing and illness are **dynamic**, meaning they are constantly changing. They are also **subjective**, meaning they mean different things to different people based on personal beliefs, feelings, or opinions. An individual's view can change over time due to events like recovery from illness. 

**Sources,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,: Optimal Health and Wellbeing as a Resource** Health (including wellbeing) is a **resource for everyday life**, not the objective of living. **Optimal health and wellbeing** means experiencing high levels of one or more dimensions. Optimal health and wellbeing is important **individually, nationally, and globally**. 

- **Individually**, it allows participation in activities, contributes to increased life expectancy and self-fulfillment. 
- **Nationally**, it means a healthier community with increased workforce participation, higher tax revenue, reduced healthcare costs, and increased social participation. 
- **Globally**, people can work together on global challenges, contribute to economic development, and reduce disease transmission across borders. 

**Sources,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,: WHO Prerequisites for Health** The **WHO's prerequisites for health** are basic conditions and resources required for gains in health and wellbeing. There are nine prerequisites: **peace, shelter, education, food, income, a stable ecosystem, sustainable resources, social justice, and equity**. These prerequisites are often interrelated. 

- **Peace** reduces destruction and allows access to resources. 
- **Shelter** provides protection and safety. 
- **Education** increases knowledge, capacity for employment, and health literacy. 
- **Food** provides nutrients and energy. 
- **Income** allows individuals to afford resources (healthcare, education, transport) and governments to provide social services and infrastructure. 
- A **stable ecosystem** provides resources like clean air and water. 
- **Sustainable resources** ensure resources are available for future generations. 
- **Social justice** means equal rights for all, regardless of personal traits. 
- **Equity** relates to fairness and targeting disadvantaged groups to ensure they have access to the resources they need. Equity is different from equality, which is about treating everyone the same. Equity is crucial for reducing health inequality. 

**Sources,,,,: Employability Skills** The VCE Health and Human Development study provides opportunities to develop **employability skills**, such as communication, teamwork, problem-solving, planning and organizing, technology, learning, self-management, initiative, and enterprise. Specific tasks like written reports, extended responses, oral presentations, visual presentations, and structured questions contribute to developing various facets of these skills. 

**Sources,: Road to Zero Initiative** The Road to Zero initiative demonstrates the application of health promotion concepts from the VCE HHD study, specifically the **Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion** (Action Areas and Strategies) and the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, to the issue of road safety. 

These key concepts and arguments form the foundation of the VCE Health and Human Development study, particularly within Unit 3 Area of Study 1, and are explored in detail across the provided sources. 

Okay, here is an extensive and comprehensive summary of VCE Health and Human Development Unit 3, drawing directly from the provided sources. 

**VCE Health and Human Development Unit 3: Australia’s health in a globalised world** 

This unit is titled "Australia’s health in a globalised world". It is one of the four units that make up the VCE Health and Human Development study. Units 3 and 4 must be undertaken as a sequence. Each unit in the study involves at least 50 hours of scheduled classroom instruction. 

In Unit 3, students examine health and wellbeing, disease, and illness, understanding them as multidimensional, dynamic, and subject to different interpretations and contexts. The unit explores health and wellbeing as a global concept and considers the benefits of optimal health and wellbeing as both an individual and a collective resource. Students analyse and evaluate variations in the health status of Australians. A key focus is on health promotion and improvements in population health over time. This involves researching health improvements, evaluating successful programs, and exploring various public health approaches and the interdependence of different models. While the emphasis is on the Australian health system, the changes in public health approaches are viewed within a global context. 

Unit 3 consists of two Areas of Study: 

- Area of Study 1: Understanding health and wellbeing 
- Area of Study 2: Promoting health in Australia 

There are two outcomes for this unit, with one for each Area of Study: 

- **Outcome 1:** Explain the complex, dynamic and global nature of health and wellbeing, interpret and apply Australia’s health status data, and analyse variations in health status. 
- **Outcome 2:** Explain changes to public health approaches, analyse improvements in population health over time and evaluate health promotion strategies and initiatives. 

Unit 3 contributes 25 per cent to the student's overall VCE Health and Human Development study score, based on School-assessed Coursework (SACs). The end-of-year examination covers content from both Units 3 and 4 and contributes 50 per cent to the study score. 

**Area of Study 1: Understanding health and wellbeing** 

This area of study focuses on understanding health and wellbeing, disease, and illness as complex, dynamic, and subjective concepts. Students reflect on the universality of public health goals and the increasing influence of global conditions on Australians. They develop their understanding of indicators used to measure and evaluate health status and the factors contributing to variations between population groups. 

The key knowledge in this area includes: 

- **Concepts of health and wellbeing and illness:** 
- Various definitions of health and wellbeing, encompassing five dimensions: **physical**, **social**, **emotional**, **mental**, and **spiritual**. These dimensions are interrelated and influence one another. Wellbeing is considered an implicit element of health in this study. Health and wellbeing is characterised by a state of equilibrium where an individual feels happy, healthy, capable, and engaged. 
- **Physical health and wellbeing** relates to the functioning of the body and its systems, including the capacity for daily activities. It's supported by factors like regular activity, balanced diet, rest, maintaining ideal body weight, and absence of illness/disease/injury. Characteristics include adequate energy, ability to complete physical tasks, appropriate fitness, and freedom from illness/disease/injury. 
- **Social health and wellbeing** is about the ability to form meaningful and satisfying relationships and manage different social situations. It involves having a well-functioning network of family and friends, clear communication, ability to adapt to social settings, developing/maintaining relationships, and positive contributions to social groups. 
- **Mental health and wellbeing** is the current state of the mind/brain, related to the ability to think and process information, form opinions, make decisions, and use logic. It's about the wellness of the mind, associated with low stress/anxiety, positive self-esteem, confidence, and optimism. 
- **Emotional health and wellbeing** relates to the ability to express feelings positively, manage emotional actions/reactions, and display resilience. It includes recognising and expressing emotions, managing/responding to emotions, experiencing positive emotions, and being resilient. 
- **Spiritual health and wellbeing** relates to ideas, beliefs, values, ethics, hope, peace, a sense of meaning/value, and reflection on one's place in the world. It 

  can involve organised religion, morals, values, purpose, connection, or belonging. Characteristics include a sense of belonging/connection, developed values/beliefs, peace/harmony, acting according to values, and positive meaning/purpose. 

- Health and wellbeing, as well as illness, are **dynamic**, meaning they are constantly changing. 
- Health and wellbeing, as well as illness, are **subjective**, meaning they are viewed differently by individuals based on their personal experiences, beliefs, and circumstances. Illness is a subjective concept related to a person's experience of a disease. 
- **Benefits of optimal health and wellbeing as a resource:** Its importance individually, nationally, and globally. 
- **Individually**, optimal health enables earning an income, exercising, socialising, sleeping well, working productively, gaining an education, and living a life valued. 
- **Nationally**, it supports higher tax revenue, increased productivity, reduced healthcare costs, longer working lives, greater social participation, and investment in infrastructure/education. 
- **Globally**, it enables people to work on global challenges like climate change, attend work/contribute internationally, reduce disease transmission across borders, promote economic development, and increase social interactions. 
- **Indicators used to measure health status:** Incidence, prevalence, morbidity, burden of disease (DALY, YLL, YLD), life expectancy, health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE), mortality (maternal, infant, under five), and self-assessed health status. 
- **Mortality** refers to deaths in a population. **Mortality rate** is deaths per 100,000 population. 
- **Morbidity** refers to illness or disease. 
- **Incidence** is the number of *new* cases of a condition in a period. 
- **Prevalence** is the *total* number of cases of a condition at a particular time. 
- **Life expectancy** is the average number of years a person is expected to live if current death rates continue. 
- **Health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE)** is the average number of years lived in full health (life expectancy minus years in unhealthy states). 
- **Burden of disease** measures the impact of diseases and injuries, showing the gap between current health status and an ideal state of living to old age free of disease/disability. It is measured in **Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY)**. 
- **DALY** equals the sum of **Years of Life Lost (YLL)** and **Years Lived with Disability (YLD)**. 
- **YLL** is years of expected life lost due to premature death from a specific cause. 
- **YLD** is years of healthy life lost due to living with illness, injury, or disability. 
- **Factors contributing to variations in health status:** Biological, sociocultural, and environmental factors. 
- **Biological factors** relate to the body's structure and function. Examples include body weight/mass, blood pressure, blood cholesterol, glucose regulation, birth weight, genetics (including sex), and age. 
- **Sociocultural factors** relate to the social and cultural conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. Examples include socioeconomic status (income, occupation, education), unemployment, social connections, social exclusion, food security (as a sociocultural concept), early life experiences, access to healthcare (as a sociocultural concept), discrimination (including racism), disability, family breakdown, and homelessness. Commercial factors, such as marketing of products like tobacco, alcohol, and processed foods, are also considered sociocultural. 
- **Environmental factors** relate to the physical surroundings. Examples include housing, work environment, urban design/infrastructure, geographical location/access to resources/transport, climate, and climate change. 
- **Contribution to Australia’s health status** of specific factors: smoking and vaping, alcohol, overweight and obesity, and nutritional imbalance (under-consumption of fruit and vegetables and dairy; high intake of fat, salt and sugar; low intake of fibre). These are largely modifiable factors that account for a significant proportion of the total burden of disease in Australia. 

The key skills in this area include: 

- Explain the dynamic and subjective nature of health and wellbeing and illness. 
- Describe the relationship between dimensions of health and wellbeing, showing how they influence each other. When describing relationships between dimensions, it is important to link specific aspects of each dimension. If asked about "relationships" (plural) between two dimensions, you should demonstrate the influence goes both ways. 
- Explain the individual, national, and global importance of health and wellbeing as a resource. 
- Interpret and apply indicators used to measure health status, using data from sources like tables and graphs. Using terms like 'approximately' helps when interpreting data values. 
- Use data to evaluate the health status of Australians. 
- Describe how examples of biological, sociocultural, and environmental factors can influence health outcomes. 
- Analyse health information to explain how factors can contribute to variations in health status between population groups. This requires linking factors to differences in health status between groups, ensuring the discussion relates to death rates or health status indicators rather than just risk of developing a condition. 

**Area of Study 2: Promoting health in Australia** 

This area of study examines different approaches to public health over time, focusing on changes and strategies that have improved health outcomes. It covers the progression of public health in Australia since 1900, noting global influences like the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion and the shift towards population health, including for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. Students investigate the Australian health system and its role in promoting health and evaluate health promotion campaigns, programs, and case studies. 

The key knowledge in this area includes: 

- **Reasons for improvements in Australia’s health status since 1900:** Focuses on **‘old’ public health**, the **biomedical approach** to health and improvements in medical technology, and the concept of the **social model of health** and the **Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion**. 
- **‘Old’ public health** involved government actions focusing on improving the physical environment, such as sanitation, housing, and infectious disease control. 
- The **biomedical approach** focuses on diagnosing and treating illness and disease once symptoms are present, using medical technology and medical expertise. 
- The **social model of health** addresses broader factors beyond the individual, including sociocultural and environmental factors, that influence health and wellbeing. 
- The **Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion** is a framework for health promotion, outlining strategies and action areas. 
- Students should understand the relationship between the biomedical and social models, including their strengths and limitations. Both approaches are often necessary to address health issues. 
- **The role of health promotion** in improving population health. This includes applying the action areas of the Ottawa Charter. 
- **Programs to improve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples’ health**, including how they promote social justice. Evaluation involves considering whether programs are culturally appropriate, involve stakeholders, address specific needs, have adequate funding, and target significant health issues. 
- **Initiatives to promote healthy eating in Australia**, including the Australian Dietary Guidelines, the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating, and the Healthy Eating Pyramid. 
- **Challenges in bringing about nutritional change**, including sociocultural, environmental, and commercial factors. Commercial factors like marketing tactics influence food practices and choices, especially for youth. 
- **Australia’s health system**, including **Medicare**, **private health insurance**, the **Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)**, and the **National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS)**, and its role in promoting health in terms of funding, sustainability, access, and equity. 
- **Medicare** is Australia's universal health insurance scheme. It is funded through the Medicare levy, Medicare levy surcharge, and general taxation. It promotes access to healthcare services like GP visits and public hospital treatment. 
- **Private health insurance** is an optional scheme for healthcare coverage. It can provide access to private hospitals with potentially shorter waiting times and cover for services not fully covered by Medicare. 
- The **PBS** subsidises the cost of a list of essential medicines, making them more affordable. It promotes access to necessary medications. The selection process contributes to its sustainability. 
- The **NDIS** provides support for people under 65 with permanent or significant disabilities to live an ordinary life. It promotes equity by targeting those with extra needs, such as requiring assistive technology. Funding from the Medicare levy surcharge contributes to its sustainability. 

The key skills in this area include: 

- Analyse data showing improvements in health over time and draw conclusions. 
- Explain how initiatives of ‘old’ public health and the social model of health, including the Ottawa Charter action areas, could lead to improved health outcomes. 
- Describe the relationship between biomedical and social models of health, including strengths and limitations. 
- Analyse data, case studies, and health promotion programs in relation to the Ottawa Charter action areas and how they can lead to improved health outcomes. 
- Analyse initiatives to improve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples’ health, how they reflect the Ottawa Charter action areas and social justice. 
- Evaluate initiatives in terms of their capacity to improve health outcomes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and promote social justice. 
- Evaluate the impact of initiatives to promote healthy eating in Australia and their ability to improve health outcomes. 
- Draw conclusions why nutritional improvements are difficult to achieve in Australia. This involves explaining challenges like sociocultural, environmental, and commercial factors. 
- Analyse the role of Medicare, private health insurance, the PBS, and the NDIS in promoting Australia’s health, considering funding, sustainability, access, and equity. 

**Assessment in Unit 3** 

Satisfactory completion for Unit 3 is awarded based on the teacher’s decision that the student has demonstrated achievement of the outcomes specified for the unit. This is determined by evidence from a range of learning activities and assessment tasks, completed mainly in class and within a limited timeframe. 

The level of achievement in Unit 3 is determined by School-assessed Coursework (SACs). Unit 3 SACs contribute 25% to the final study score. 

Suitable tasks for SACs in Unit 3 (for Outcome 1 and Outcome 2) may be selected from the following: 

- A **written report** (e.g., media analysis, research investigation, blog post, case study analysis). 
- An **extended response question** analysing various stimuli with an emphasis on annotating, synthesising, and planning. Extended responses often require using information from provided sources and own knowledge. 
- An **oral presentation** (e.g., debate, podcast). 
- A **visual presentation** (e.g., concept map, annotated poster, digital presentation). 
- **Structured questions**, including data analysis or case study analysis. 

Each task type can only be selected once across Outcome 1 and Outcome 2 in Unit 3. Outcome 1 is allocated 50 marks for SAC assessment, and Outcome 2 is allocated 50 marks, for a total of 100 marks for Unit 3 SACs. 

Work submitted for assessment must be authenticated by the teacher as the student's own, unacknowledged work.

This summary provides a comprehensive overview of the key content and skills for VCE Health and Human Development Unit 3 based on the provided sources. 

Okay, here is a comprehensive breakdown of the key points and notes for VCE Health and Human Development Unit 3, organised by Area of Study, drawing on the provided sources. 

**VCE Health and Human Development Unit 3: Australia’s Health in a Globalised World** 

This unit explores health and wellbeing, disease, and illness as complex, dynamic, and subjective concepts in a global context. It focuses on the benefits of optimal health and wellbeing, variations in Australians' health status, and health promotion efforts over time. The unit also examines the Australian health system and public health approaches. Unit 3 contributes 25 per cent to the overall study score through School-assessed Coursework (SAC) and 50 per cent through the end-of-year examination, which covers both Units 3 and 4 content. 

**Unit 3 Area of Study 1: Understanding health and wellbeing** 

In this area of study, students investigate health and wellbeing and illness, focusing on their complex, dynamic, and subjective nature. They examine indicators of health status, factors contributing to variations in health status, and the increasing influence of global conditions on Australians. 

Key Knowledge points and notes for AOS 1: 

- **Concepts of health and wellbeing (physical, social, emotional, mental and spiritual dimensions), illness, and the dynamic and subjective nature of these concepts** 
- For the purposes of this study, 'health' is a broad term encompassing health and wellbeing, health status, and associated health outcomes. 
- Health and wellbeing is defined as a state of physical, social, emotional, mental, and spiritual existence, characterised by an equilibrium where an individual feels happy, healthy, capable, and engaged. Wellbeing is considered an implicit element of health. 
- The **five dimensions** of health and wellbeing are: 
- **Physical health and wellbeing:** Relates to the functioning of the body and its systems, including the physical capacity to perform daily activities or tasks. It is supported by factors like regular physical activity, a balanced diet, adequate rest/sleep, maintaining ideal body weight, and the absence of illness, disease, or injury. Having these supportive factors does not automatically mean optimal physical health and wellbeing, as they are not part of the body or its systems. 
- **Social health and wellbeing:** Concerns the ability to form meaningful relationships with others and manage or adapt appropriately to social situations. It includes aspects like supportive networks, effective communication, and a sense of connection to community. 
- **Emotional health and wellbeing:** Involves the ability to express feelings in a positive way, manage emotional actions and reactions, and display resilience. 
- **Mental health and wellbeing:** Relates to the state of a person’s mind or brain and the ability to think and process information. It includes having positive thought patterns, low levels of stress and anxiety, and the ability to use the mind to make decisions. 
- **Spiritual health and wellbeing:** Relates to ideas, beliefs, values, and ethics, including hope, peace, a sense of meaning or value, and reflection on one's place in the world. It can be highly individualised, relating to organised religion, morals, a sense of purpose, or connection/belonging. 
- The five dimensions are **interrelated** and influence one another. A change in one dimension typically affects the others. Demonstrating interrelationships involves showing how the impact on one dimension leads to an impact on another. For example, participating in sports (physical) can lead to building relationships (social), which can improve self-esteem (mental). When showing relationships between two dimensions, provide examples of how each can affect the other. 
- Health and wellbeing is **dynamic**, meaning it is constantly changing. An individual's health can improve or decline rapidly. 
- Health and wellbeing is **subjective**, meaning it is influenced by personal opinions, beliefs, and feelings. How a person perceives their health may differ from someone else's perception, even with the same medical condition. Illness is also a subjective concept related to a person's experience of a disease. 
- Illness is a concept related to negative aspects of health and wellbeing. Disease is a physical or mental disturbance, while illness is the subjective experience of it. 
- **Benefits of optimal health and wellbeing and its importance as a resource individually, nationally and globally** 
- Optimal health and wellbeing is a **resource for everyday life**. 
- **Individually:** Optimal health and wellbeing allows individuals to perform daily activities effectively, work productively, earn an income, participate in social activities, exercise, gain an education, and live a life they value. For example, being free of disease allows individuals to work and earn income, which can be used for resources like food, shelter, and healthcare, further promoting health and wellbeing. 
- **Nationally:** A healthy population is a valuable asset to a country. Optimal health and wellbeing contributes to a productive workforce, increased taxation revenue, reduced healthcare costs, greater social participation (like volunteering), and improved national security. Increased tax revenue can be reinvested in education and infrastructure, further improving national health and wellbeing. 
- **Globally:** Optimal health and wellbeing allows people to work together on global challenges (e.g., climate change), contributes to global economic development, and reduces the risk of disease transmission across borders. Reduced communicable diseases mean fewer deaths and symptoms, allowing more people to be productive globally. 
- **Indicators used to measure and understand health status** 
- **Health status** refers to a person's overall health, which can be measured using various indicators. Using data to evaluate the health status of Australians is a key skill. 
- **Incidence:** The number or rate of *new* cases of a particular condition during a specific period of time. 
- **Prevalence:** The *total* number or proportion of cases of a particular condition present in a population at a given time. 
- **Morbidity:** Refers to ill health in an individual or population group. It measures the level of sickness or disability in a population. 
- **Burden of disease:** A measure of the impact of diseases and injuries, measuring the gap between current health status and an ideal situation where everyone lives to an old age free of disease and disability. It is measured in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY). Burden of disease is often related to a specific condition or injury. 
- **Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY):** A measure of burden of disease, where one DALY equals one year of healthy life lost due to premature death or time lived with illness, disease, or injury. 
- **Years of Life Lost (YLL):** The fatal component of DALYs. It measures the years of expected life lost due to premature death from a particular condition. One YLL equals one year of healthy life lost due to premature death. 
- **Years Lived with Disability (YLD):** The non-fatal component of DALYs. It measures the years of healthy life lost due to illness, injury, or disability. One YLD equals one year of healthy life lost due to living with the negative impacts of disease, injury, or disability. 
- DALY = YLL + YLD. Some conditions contribute more to YLL, while others contribute more to YLD, but all contribute to both measures in some way. 
- **Mortality:** Refers to death, particularly at a population level. Different types include maternal, infant, and under five mortality. 
- **Life expectancy:** The average number of years an individual is expected to live if current death rates remain the same. 
- **Health-Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE):** The average number of years an individual can expect to live in full health, free from serious illness, injury, or disability. 
- **Self-assessed health status:** A measure based on a person's own opinion about how healthy they are. 
- **Biological, sociocultural and environmental factors that contribute to variations in health status between population groups** 
- These factors explain differences in health outcomes between groups. When discussing variations, refer to *both* groups being compared and the difference in their health outcomes or health status. 
- **Biological factors:** Relate to the body and its functioning. Examples include genetics, body weight/mass, blood pressure, blood cholesterol levels, glucose regulation, birth weight, age, and sex/genetics. High body weight, for instance, can increase blood pressure, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Being female increases the risk of osteoporosis and breast cancer. Genetics can predispose individuals to certain conditions. 
- **Sociocultural factors:** Relate to the social and cultural conditions in which people live. Examples include socioeconomic status (income, occupation, education), level of education, employment status/unemployment, cultural background/traditions, social networks (family, peer group), social expectations and attitudes (gender expectations), social exclusion, food security, early life experiences, access to healthcare (when discussed culturally or socially, not geographically), and commercial factors. Lower education, for example, can lead to lower health literacy and delayed healthcare access, increasing death rates for conditions like heart disease. Social exclusion can lead to poor social connections, impacting mental and emotional health and wellbeing. Commercial factors, such as the marketing of unhealthy foods to youth, can influence dietary practices. 
- **Environmental factors:** Relate to the physical surroundings. Examples include geographic location, quality of air and water, safe workplaces, housing environment, community safety, and access to physical resources within a community (transportation, recreation facilities, health services). Geographical distance affecting access to resources like education or healthcare would be an environmental, not sociocultural, discussion. 
- **The contribution to Australia’s health status of: smoking and vaping, alcohol, overweight and obesity, nutritional imbalance (under-consumption of fruit and vegetables, and dairy foods; high intake of fat, salt and sugar; low intake of fibre)** 
- These factors significantly influence Australia's health status. Understanding their contribution to burden of disease is important. 
- **Smoking and vaping:** Linked to numerous conditions and contribute to YLL and YLD. 
- **Alcohol:** Can contribute to various health issues. 
- **Overweight and obesity:** Increase the risk of morbidity from conditions like cardiovascular disease and some cancers. High body weight is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Maintaining an ideal body weight supports physical health. 
- **Nutritional imbalance:** 
- **Under-consumption of fruit and vegetables:** Fruit and vegetables provide antioxidants that prevent the impact of free radicals, and under-consumption can increase the prevalence of conditions like cancer. 
- **Under-consumption of dairy foods:** Dairy is high in calcium, important for bone density. Under-consumption increases the risk of osteoporosis. 
- **High intake of fat, salt and sugar:** Can contribute to overweight/obesity and other health issues. Excess kilojoules from fat and sugar can lead to weight gain. 
- **Low intake of fibre:** Fibre is important for digestive health and can reduce the risk of certain diseases. Low fibre intake contributes significantly to DALYs for some diseases.

**Unit 3 Area of Study 2: Promoting health in Australia** 

This area of study focuses on different approaches to public health in Australia since 1900 and evaluates health promotion strategies and initiatives. Students examine the Australian health system and its role in promoting health. 

Key Knowledge points and notes for AOS 2: 

- **Reasons for improvements in Australia’s health status since 1900, focusing on: ‘old’ public health, the biomedical approach to health and improvements in medical technology, the concept of the social model of health and the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion (not including the principles of the social model of health)** 
- Improvements in health status have occurred over time, shifting from infectious diseases to chronic illnesses as leading causes of death. 
- **‘Old’ public health:** Focused on environmental sanitation, hygiene, and disease control. Initiatives included establishing government-funded water and sewerage systems, improved housing, and better nutrition. These initiatives were crucial in reducing infectious diseases. 
- **Biomedical approach to health:** Focuses on the physical or biological aspects of disease and illness, practised by doctors and health professionals. It is associated with diagnosing, curing, and treating disease at an individual level. Improvements in medical technology (like CT scans) and drug therapies (like blood pressure medication) are examples of the biomedical approach. It has strengths in treating acute conditions and extending life expectancy. Limitations include being costly, focusing on individuals rather than populations, and not addressing underlying causes. 
- **Social model of health:** Recognises that health and wellbeing are influenced by a range of factors beyond the individual, including social, environmental, and economic conditions. Key aspects include policies, education, and health promotion activities. Strengths include addressing root causes, promoting equity, and being cost-effective in the long term. Limitations include not addressing immediate health crises and difficulty changing behaviour. 
- **Relationship between biomedical and social models:** Both models are important and work together to reduce the burden of disease. The biomedical model treats existing conditions, while the social model addresses the factors that cause them. 
- **Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion:** A framework developed from the social model of health. It outlines strategies for health promotion. Action areas of the Ottawa Charter can be applied to address chronic diseases. 
- **The role of health promotion in improving population health** 
- Health promotion aims to enable people to increase control over, and to improve, their health. 
- It involves implementing initiatives that reflect the action areas of the Ottawa Charter. 
- **Programs to improve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples’ health, including how they promote social justice** 
- Programs should include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge and perspectives. 
- Effective programs often involve various stakeholders and are culturally appropriate. 
- Social justice principles, such as equity, access, and participation, are important for addressing health inequities faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. Equity addresses factors causing inequality and provides targeted support. 
- Examples of programs or organisations include the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO), which represents Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHSs). ACCHSs are primary healthcare services initiated and operated by local Aboriginal communities to deliver holistic, comprehensive, and culturally appropriate healthcare. Programs like the 'Care for Kids' Ears' initiative aim to increase awareness and education about ear health in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The 'Move it Mob Style' program promotes fitness through dance and culturally appropriate music. 
- **Initiatives to promote healthy eating in Australia, including the Australian Dietary Guidelines, the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Guide to Healthy Eating** 
- These initiatives provide guidance on healthy eating. 
- **Australian Dietary Guidelines (ADGs):** Written recommendations, including eating a variety of nutritious foods from five food groups, limiting foods high in saturated fat, added salt, and sugar, and encouraging breastfeeding. 
- **Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE):** A visual food selection model showing the proportion of food from the five food groups that should be consumed daily. It is a visual representation of the ADGs. 
- **Healthy Eating Pyramid:** Another visual food selection model promoting healthy eating among youth. It visually shows the proportion of foods from five food groups and draws attention to limiting foods with added sugar. 
- **Challenges in bringing about nutritional change, including sociocultural, environmental and commercial factors** 
- Sociocultural challenges include family and culture influencing dietary choices. 
- Commercial factors, such as the marketing and promotion of food to youth, particularly unhealthy foods, can significantly influence dietary practices and make changes difficult. Children may eat more after watching junk food ads. 
- Environmental challenges might include access to healthy food options based on geographic location. 
- **Australia’s health system, including Medicare, private health insurance, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), and its role in promoting health in terms of funding, sustainability, access and equity** 
- **Medicare:** Australia's universal healthcare scheme. It is funded by the Medicare levy, Medicare levy surcharge, and general taxation. It provides access to a wide range of health services, including public hospital treatment. Medicare promotes **access** by making many health services free or subsidised. It promotes **equity** as it's available to all citizens regardless of income. Its **sustainability** depends on adequate funding. 
- **Private health insurance:** An optional cover for healthcare costs. It covers private hospital care and treatment, potentially offering shorter waiting times. It can cover alternative medicines. Private health insurance promotes **access** to private healthcare services. It can impact **equity**, as access depends on the ability to pay for premiums. Its **sustainability** relies on people purchasing cover. 
- **Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS):** Subsidises the cost of essential medicines. It aims to make access to medication fair for all individuals. PBS promotes **access** by reducing the cost of medicines. It promotes **equity** as it's available to all Australians. Its **sustainability** involves careful selection of medicines included. 
- **National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS):** Provides services and support for eligible people under 65 with permanent and significant 

  disabilities. It aims for participants to live an ordinary life and access mainstream services. NDIS promotes **equity** by targeting people with extra needs. Its **sustainability** is supported by funding sources like the increased Medicare levy surcharge. NDIS promotes **access** to necessary support services and assistive technology. 

Key Skills for AOS 2:

When considering multiple sources together, several overarching themes and central ideas emerge regarding the VCE Health and Human Development study, particularly focusing on Unit 3: Australia's health in a globalised world. 

Here are the central themes derived from the provided sources: 

- **Holistic and Multidimensional Understanding of Health and Wellbeing:** A primary theme across the sources is that health and wellbeing is a complex concept that extends beyond the absence of disease. It is consistently described as having five interrelated dimensions: **physical, social, emotional, mental, and spiritual**. The interrelationships between these dimensions are a key aspect of understanding overall health. The dynamic and subjective nature of health and wellbeing and illness is also a core concept, meaning it changes over time and is perceived differently by individuals. 
- **Importance of Optimal Health and Wellbeing as a Resource:** The benefits of achieving optimal health and wellbeing are highlighted as being significant not just for individuals, but also for the nation and the globe. This perspective frames health not just as a personal goal, but as a foundation that enables broader societal and global progress. 
- **Measurement and Analysis of Health Status:** Measuring and understanding the health of populations using specific indicators is a fundamental skill and knowledge area. Indicators such as **incidence, prevalence, morbidity, mortality (including maternal, infant, under five), life expectancy, health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE), burden of disease (DALY, YLL, YLD), and self-assessed health status** are central terms and tools. Students are expected to interpret and apply data related to these indicators. 
- **Factors Influencing Health Outcomes:** The study emphasizes the complex interplay of factors that influence health status and outcomes. These are broadly classified into **biological, sociocultural, and environmental factors**. Specific examples within these categories are core knowledge points for understanding variations in health. 
- **Public Health Approaches and Health Promotion:** Understanding the evolution of public health strategies is a key theme in Unit 3 AOS2. This includes the transition from **'old' public health and the biomedical model** to the **social model of health** and the framework of the **Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion**. The strengths, limitations, and relationship between the biomedical and social models are important concepts. Health promotion, particularly through the action areas of the Ottawa Charter, is central to improving population health. 
- **Australia's Health System:** The structure and function of Australia's health system, including **Medicare, Private Health Insurance, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), and the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS)**, and their role in promoting health through funding, sustainability, access, and equity, is a specific area of study. 
- **Cross-Curriculum Priorities:** Several significant themes are woven throughout the study, reflecting contemporary global and national priorities. These include **social justice and equity**, **sustainability** (environmental, economic, social), and the inclusion of **Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples' knowledge, culture, and perspectives** on health and wellbeing. 
- **Development of Key Skills:** The study design explicitly lists Key Skills alongside Key Knowledge, indicating that application, analysis, interpretation, evaluation, and explanation are central to demonstrating understanding. This is supported by resources emphasizing data analysis and assessment approaches, including extended responses that require synthesis and critical thinking. The concept of **health literacy** is foundational to developing these skills. 
- **Structured Curriculum and Assessment:** The VCE HHD study is structured into four units, each with specific Areas of Study, Key Knowledge, Key Skills, and outcomes. Assessment is clearly defined, including school-based coursework (SACs) for each unit and an end-of-year external examination for Units 3 and 4. 

These themes collectively demonstrate the comprehensive nature of the VCE Health and Human Development study, which requires students to understand health and wellbeing from multiple perspectives, analyze complex factors and data, evaluate public health strategies, and consider the broader global context of health. 

Drawing on the provided sources and our conversation history, several significant connections and areas of agreement emerge when considering the multiple sources together in the context of VCE Health and Human Development Unit 3. While there are minor variations in emphasis or specific examples, the core framework and key knowledge points are remarkably consistent. 

Here are the notable connections and areas of agreement: 

- **Centrality of the VCE Study Design (2025-2029):** This is the foundational document that all other resources refer to or are based upon. Multiple sources explicitly state that they are aligned with the **VCE Health and Human Development Study Design 2025-2029**. The most current version available (Version 1.2, updated July 2024) is specifically referenced. The Study Design provides the definitive list of Key Knowledge and Key Skills students must master. 
- **Definition and Dimensions of Health and Wellbeing:** There is strong agreement on the core definition of health and wellbeing as a multidimensional concept, extending beyond the absence of disease. All relevant sources consistently identify the **five dimensions: physical, social, emotional, mental, and spiritual**. The dynamic and subjective nature of health and wellbeing and illness is also a shared concept. 
- **Key Health Status Indicators:** The list of essential indicators used to measure the health of populations is consistently presented: **incidence, prevalence, morbidity, burden of disease (DALY, YLL, YLD), mortality (maternal, infant, under five), life expectancy, health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE), and self-assessed health status**. Understanding how to interpret these indicators is a core skill. 
- **Factors Influencing Health:** The three broad categories of factors influencing health status – **biological, sociocultural, and environmental** – are fundamental and consistently referenced. Specific examples within these categories, such as socioeconomic status (income, education, occupation), social exclusion, access to healthcare (sociocultural), genetics, body weight, blood pressure (biological), and housing, work environment, geographical location (environmental), appear across various materials. The Study Design also identifies specific factors like smoking, alcohol, overweight/obesity, and nutritional imbalance for detailed study regarding their contribution to Australia's health status and burden of disease. 
- **Public Health Approaches and Health Promotion:** The historical progression of public health, including **'old' public health, the biomedical model, the social model of health, and the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion**, is a key area of study in Unit 3 AOS 2. The Study Design explicitly requires understanding the relationship, strengths, and limitations of the biomedical and social models, and applying the Ottawa Charter action areas. 
- **Australia's Health System Components:** Medicare, private health insurance, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), and the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) are consistently listed as key aspects of Australia's health system relevant to Unit 3, with an emphasis on their role in funding, sustainability, access, and equity. 
- **Assessment Structure and Weighting:** The structure of assessment for Units 3 and 4, consisting of School-assessed Coursework (SACs) and an end-of-year external examination, is uniform. The percentage contributions to the study score (Unit 3 SAC: 25%, Unit 4 SAC: 25%, Exam: 50%) are also consistently stated. The types of tasks suitable for SACs (written reports, presentations, structured questions, extended responses) are also listed similarly across relevant sources. 
- **Importance of Data Analysis and Key Skills:** Analysing and interpreting data is highlighted as a crucial skill throughout the study. Resources often link content directly to the Key Skills outlined in the Study Design, demonstrating how knowledge should be applied. 
- **Emphasis on Assessment Terminology and Strategy:** Resources provide guidance on understanding command words and structuring responses, particularly for extended response questions, indicating these are important skills for success in assessments. 

**Notable Variations/Contradictions:** 

- **Specific Data Points:** While sources agree on the types of health status indicators and general trends (like the shift from infectious to chronic diseases), the exact numerical data presented for these indicators can vary, likely due to different reporting periods or data sources used in the creation of the materials. This underscores the importance of interpreting the data provided *within the assessment* rather than memorizing specific figures. 
- **Depth and Structure of Explanations:** Different resources offer varying levels of detail and structural approaches to explaining the same concepts. The Study Design lists the content. Textbooks and notes provide more in-depth explanations and examples. Video transcripts might focus on demonstrating a specific skill (like linking dimensions) or explaining complex terms (like burden of disease) with specific examples. This isn't a contradiction but shows the complementary nature of different resource types. 
- **Terminology Updates:** One source specifically points out a minor terminology change in the Study Design from "priorities" to "goals and objectives" regarding the WHO. This highlights that even official documents can have minor updates and underscores the need to use the latest versions. 

In summary, the sources provide a cohesive and largely consistent picture of the requirements for VCE Health and Human Development Unit 3. They collectively reinforce the importance of understanding the **multidimensional nature of health and wellbeing, the indicators of health status, the factors that influence health outcomes, and the evolution of public health approaches in Australia**. The assessment methods and key skills required are also clearly outlined and consistently presented. The primary value of 

consulting multiple sources together lies in gaining slightly different perspectives, levels of detail, and practical examples that can enhance understanding and preparation for assessment tasks. 

Here are some key takeaways and crucial facts from the sources, presented as concise bullet points, that would be valuable content for a website focusing on VCE Health and Human Development: 

- **VCE Health and Human Development** is a study that takes a broad and multidimensional approach to understanding health and wellbeing. It is accredited for the period 2025-2029. 
- The study is structured into four units: Unit 1: Understanding health and wellbeing, Unit 2: Managing health and development, Unit 3: Australia’s health in a globalised world, and Unit 4: Health and human development in a global context. 
- Units 3 and 4 must be undertaken as a sequence. Each unit involves at least 50 hours of scheduled classroom instruction. 
- **Health and wellbeing** is a complex, dynamic, and subjective concept. It is understood through five interrelated dimensions: **physical, social, emotional, mental, and spiritual**. These dimensions all affect each other. 
- **Optimal health and wellbeing** is considered a resource for individuals, the nation, and the globe. Achieving it allows people to engage in activities that improve their lives and contribute to broader progress. 
- **Health status** refers to an individual's or population's overall level of health and wellbeing, measured using various indicators. Key **health status indicators** include incidence, prevalence, morbidity, mortality (maternal, infant, under five), life expectancy, health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE), burden of disease (DALY, YLL, YLD), and self-assessed health status. 
- **Burden of disease** measures the impact of diseases and injuries as the gap between current health status and an ideal state of perfect health, measured in **Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY)**. DALY is the sum of **Years of Life Lost (YLL)** due to premature death and **Years Lived with Disability (YLD)** due to living with illness or injury. 
- Variations in health status and outcomes are influenced by the complex interplay of **biological, sociocultural, and environmental factors**. Specific factors like smoking, alcohol, overweight/obesity, and nutritional imbalance contribute significantly to Australia's burden of disease. Sociocultural factors include income, education, occupation (SES), social exclusion, access to healthcare, discrimination, and unemployment. Biological factors include genetics, body weight, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol levels. 
- Understanding **public health approaches** is key, including the shift from 'old' public health and the biomedical model to the social model of health and the **Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion**. The strengths and limitations of the biomedical and social models are examined. 
- The **Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion** outlines action areas for health promotion, including strengthening community action, developing personal skills, and creating supportive environments. 
- Key components of **Australia's health system** studied include Medicare, Private Health Insurance, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), and the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Their roles in terms of funding, sustainability, access, and equity are analysed. 
- The study incorporates **cross-curriculum priorities** such as sustainability (environmental, economic, and social dimensions), social justice, equity, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples' perspectives on health and wellbeing. 
- Developing **health literacy** is a core aim, enabling students to access, critique, understand, and use health information and services effectively. This involves functional, interactive, and critical dimensions. 
- The study emphasizes **critical inquiry** and **data analysis**, requiring students to interpret various data types and measures to evaluate health status and trends. 
- Assessment for Units 3 and 4 includes School-assessed Coursework (SACs) and an end-of-year external examination. SACs contribute 25% for Unit 3 and 25% for Unit 4, while the external examination contributes 50% to the study score. 
- SAC tasks can include written reports (like media analysis, research investigation, blog post, case study analysis), extended response questions, oral presentations (debate, podcast), visual presentations (concept map, annotated poster, digital presentation), and structured questions (data analysis, case study analysis). Each task type can only be selected once across the outcomes for each unit. 
- The end-of-year examination is 2 hours long and covers all Key Knowledge and Key Skills from Units 3 and 4.

Based on the sources and our conversation history, here's how you will likely be assessed for the School-assessed Coursework (SAC) related to Unit 3 Area of Study 2 (Promoting health in Australia) if it is an extended response, and some resources that would be helpful: 

**Assessment for Unit 3 Area of Study 2 SAC (Extended Response)** 

If your teacher selects an extended response question as the assessment task for Unit 3 Area of Study 2, as suggested by one of the sources, here's how it would be structured and marked: 

1. **Total Marks:** The SAC for Outcome 2 (which covers Area of Study 2) is allocated **50 marks**. This 50-mark SAC task is part of the School-assessed Coursework for Unit 3. 
1. **Contribution to Study Score:** The Unit 3 School-assessed Coursework, including this SAC, contributes **25 per cent** to your overall VCE Health and Human Development study score. 
1. **Assessment Components (as per the "extended response slide"):** This specific type of extended response SAC is broken down into three components for marking: 
- **Annotations:** 10 marks. This suggests you will be provided with stimulus material (sources) that you need to annotate. 
- **Planning:** 30 marks. This involves interpreting the stimulus material, synthesising relationships between the stimuli and the question, and planning your response, including how to incorporate your own knowledge. 
- **Extended response writing:** 10 marks. This is the written part of your response, drawing on your planning, annotations, and knowledge. 
4. **Time Allocation:** The suggested time for this 50-mark SAC is **1 hour and 45 minutes** in total. This time is typically split, for example, 45 minutes for annotation and 1 hour for planning and writing the extended response. 
4. **Satisfactory Completion:** To achieve satisfactory completion ('S') for Unit 3, you must demonstrate achievement of both Outcome 1 and Outcome 2. This involves completing all SACs. 

The content assessed in this SAC will cover the Key Knowledge and Key Skills for Unit 3 Area of Study 2. This includes reasons for health status improvements since 1900, public health approaches (like the social model and Ottawa Charter), the biomedical approach, health promotion initiatives, challenges in nutritional change, and Australia's health system (Medicare, PHI, PBS, NDIS). 

**Helpful Resources for this Assessment** 

Several resources mentioned in the sources can be highly beneficial for preparing for this type of assessment: 

1. **The VCE Health and Human Development Study Design 2025-2029:** This is the essential document. You should carefully review **Unit 3 Area of Study 2: Promoting health in Australia**, focusing on the Key Knowledge and Key Skills listed. Familiarising yourself with the specific content points will ensure you cover everything required. 
1. **VCAA Support materials:** These resources, which incorporate the former "Advice for teachers", provide guidance on developing learning programs and assessment tasks aligned with the study design. While primarily for teachers, they can offer insights into assessment expectations. 
1. **Practice SACs and Questions:** Resources like the ACHPER Unit 3 Practice SAC Pack explicitly include task types relevant to Outcome 2, such as Structured Questions and Media Analysis, and indicate they may include Extended Responses. Other resources like ATAR Notes also provide study guides and practice questions tailored to the 2025 study design. These often include sample questions covering the content and may provide sample answers. 
1. **Resources on Extended Response Strategy:** Several sources offer advice specifically on approaching extended response questions: 
   1. Breaking down the question: Use techniques like using forward slashes or color-coding to identify all the required components of the question. 
   1. Using Stimulus Material: Practice interpreting data (tables, graphs, infographics) and text-based sources. Learn how to annotate and synthesise information from multiple sources. 
   1. Incorporating Own Knowledge: Understand how to link your learned content to the stimulus material provided. 
   1. Answering Techniques: Familiarise yourself with command terms (analyse, explain, discuss, evaluate, etc.) and what they require in your answer. Structure your response logically, potentially using a framework like TEEL (Topic Sentence, Evidence, Explanation, Link) for paragraphs. 
   1. Focus on Links and Impacts: Practice explaining the potential reasons, impacts, strengths, and limitations related to the concepts being assessed. 
1. **VCAA Past Exams and Reports:** While the study design has changed for 2025, reviewing past VCAA exams and examiner reports for Units 3 & 4 can provide insight into question styles, common student errors, and what constitutes a high-scoring response (though content may differ). Some reports or associated videos may even discuss how questions of higher mark allocation (similar to extended responses) were assessed. 
6. **Specific Content Resources:** Materials that detail the Key Knowledge points for Unit 3 AOS 2, such as notes on the social model of health, the Ottawa Charter action areas, the biomedical model, the Australian health system components (Medicare, PHI, PBS, NDIS), and challenges in dietary change, will provide the foundational knowledge needed for the response. 

By utilizing these resources, you can gain a clear understanding of the assessment requirements and develop the necessary knowledge and skills to perform well on the Unit 3 Area of Study 2 Extended Response SAC. 

Based on the sources and our conversation history, here are clear examples, illustrations, and case studies from Unit 3 Area of Study 2 content that could be adapted or summarized for a website to clarify concepts: 

1. **Public Health Approaches (Biomedical vs Social Model & Ottawa Charter)** 
- **Illustrating the Biomedical Approach:** The sources provide concrete examples of interventions within this model. These could be used to show its focus on diagnosis and treatment of existing disease: 
  - Use of **X-rays for diagnosis and treatment** 
  - Prescribing **antibiotics and other medications**, such as blood pressure lowering medication for cardiovascular disease 
  - Performing **surgery**, like heart surgery procedures 
  - Carrying out **transplants** 
- **Illustrating the Social Model of Health:** This approach is characterized by focusing on broader factors and includes policies, education, and health promotion activities. A simple explanation could highlight this shift from individual blame. 
- **Illustrating the Relationship between Biomedical and Social Models:** The sources emphasize that both models are needed to improve health status and reduce the burden of disease. An example using cardiovascular disease (CVD) could be used: 
  - The **biomedical model diagnoses and treats CVD** with medication or surgery to reduce mortality and burden of disease. 
  - The **social model addresses the underlying factors** causing CVD, aiming to prevent it from occurring in the first place. Both working together provide comprehensive care and prevention. 
- **Illustrating Ottawa Charter Action Areas:** The Ottawa Charter provides a framework for health promotion with five action areas. Specific examples for each area are excellent for illustration: 
- **Build Healthy Public Policy:** Laws for **compulsory seatbelts**, a national 

  **0.05 blood alcohol concentration limit**, or **speed limits** in school zones. 

- **Create Supportive Environments:** Installation of **bicycle lanes** or **pedestrian areas**, and the **Driver Reviver program** offering rest stops. The "Pillow Pitstops" along roads for drowsy drivers are a specific example. 
- **Strengthen Community Action:** The **Central Australian Aboriginal Congress (CAAC)** is given as an example of an Aboriginal-run health service with high community participation. **Australian Transport Council working with police** on roadside testing is another. 
- **Develop Personal Skills:** **Health curriculum in schools** on topics like alcohol use or safe use of cooking equipment, **healthy cooking classes** at a community centre, or the **Quit campaign educating about smoking**. The "Walk to School program" educating children on active transport benefits or the "Pillow Program" educating drivers on avoiding drowsy driving are specific examples. 
- **Reorient Health Services:** Doctors acting as **educators** or ambulance workers providing **road safety sessions** at schools. 
2. **Australia's Health System** 
- **Illustrating Medicare:** Explain that it's Australia's universal healthcare system. A key detail is how it's funded: **Medicare levy (2% tax), Medicare levy surcharge, and general taxation**. Explain how it **promotes access** by subsidising public hospital stays and making access fair. 
- **Illustrating Private Health Insurance (PHI):** Explain its role alongside Medicare. Illustrate its benefits with examples like **covering private hospital care with potentially shorter waiting times** for procedures like CVD surgery. Mention it can cover alternative medicines. 
- **Illustrating the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS):** Explain its purpose to subsidize essential medicines. Illustrate how it **improves access by subsidising costs** to make medication fair for all, allowing people to manage conditions and perform daily tasks (promoting physical health). 
- **Illustrating the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS):** Explain its role in providing support for people with permanent or significant disability. Illustrate how it **promotes equity** by targeting people with extra needs (like assistive technology) so they can live an ordinary life. Illustrate how it **promotes sustainability** as funding (partly from the increased Medicare levy surcharge) helps provide long-term services. 
3. **Health Promotion Initiatives and Challenges in Nutritional Change** 
- **Illustrating Healthy Eating Tools:** 
- The **Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE)**: A visual tool showing proportions of five food groups, easy for the public to understand and use with the Dietary Guidelines. It is visually presented. 
- The **Healthy Eating Pyramid**: Another visual tool based on the guidelines, easy to follow, includes water, physical activity, and reducing salt/sugar. 
- **Illustrating Challenges in Dietary Change:** Use specific examples of factors that make healthy eating difficult: 
- **Sociocultural factors:** **Family and culture** influencing food choices (e.g., limited to meals prepared by family, potentially high in fat and salt). 
- **Commercial factors:** **Food marketing and media**, particularly to children, showing that watching junk food ads leads to consuming more energy. 
4. **Programs to Improve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples' Health** 
- **Illustrating a Community-Controlled Service:** The **National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO)** is described as a national peak body representing local ACCHSs that provide holistic, comprehensive, and culturally appropriate health care initiated and operated by the local community. This demonstrates **Strengthen Community Action** and alignment with Aboriginal community control. 
- **Illustrating a Specific Health Promotion Program:** 
- **Care for Kids' Ears initiative:** A program addressing otitis media (ear infections) that provides **information resources for health professionals, communities, and schools**. It uses **apps and kiosks in 22 Indigenous languages** and **media partnerships**. This is culturally appropriate and helps individuals develop personal skills. Evaluation showed increased awareness and knowledge among mothers. 
- **Move it Mob Style:** A **dance-based fitness program** for TV and online, showcasing Aboriginal music and dance, led by Indigenous people. It's described as **culturally appropriate** and well-received, demonstrating creating supportive environments. 

These examples, supported by the sources, provide concrete and illustrative content to explain the key concepts within Unit 3 Area of Study 2 for a VCE Health and Human Development website. 

Based on the provided excerpts from "2025 Health Human Developments d | PDF | Sustainability | Well Being", the source primarily contains the VCE Health and Human Development Study Design framework and details about assessment tasks and subject outlines. 

While the source discusses the importance of data analysis and mentions types of visual data students will encounter or use, such as **tables, graphs (for example, bar, line and pie graphs), infographics, quotations and case studies**, it does **not contain actual examples of these charts, diagrams, or illustrative images** related to specific health concepts *within* the content of the study design or subject descriptions provided in these excerpts. 

The source includes some tabular formatting to outline outcomes and assessment tasks, but these are structural tables describing the course requirements, not visual representations of health data or diagrams illustrating concepts like the biomedical model or the Ottawa Charter. There is also a school logo. 

Therefore, this specific source does not contain clear charts, diagrams, tables (presenting health data), or significant illustrative images that could be directly adapted or summarized for a website to clarify the health concepts discussed in the VCE Health and Human Development course, based solely on the provided excerpts. It focuses more on the structure and requirements of the study. 

Okay, here is a master list compiling significant concepts, definitions, examples, and data points extracted from the provided sources, which you plan to include and adapt for your website on VCE Health and Human Development Unit 3. 

This list is structured around the Key Knowledge and Key Skills outlined in the study design excerpts. 

**Unit 3: Australia’s Health in a Globalised World** 

**Area of Study 1: Understanding Health and Wellbeing** 

- **Concepts of Health and Wellbeing and Illness** 
- **Definition of Health and Wellbeing**: A broad, overarching term including health and wellbeing, health status, and associated health outcomes. Relates to a person’s physical, social, emotional, mental, and spiritual existence, characterised by equilibrium where the individual feels happy, healthy, capable, and engaged. Wellbeing is considered an implicit element of health. 
- **WHO Definition of Health**: A state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity (1946). Clarified as a resource for everyday life, not the objective of living, enabling individuals/groups to realise aspirations, satisfy needs, and cope with the environment. 
- **Five Dimensions of Health and Wellbeing**: Physical, Social, Emotional, Mental, and Spiritual. They are interrelated, not discrete. (Mnemonic suggested: Physical MESS). 
- **Physical Health and Wellbeing**: Functioning of the body and its systems; physical capacity to perform daily activities. Supported by regular physical activity, balanced diet, appropriate rest/sleep, maintaining ideal body weight, absence of illness/disease/injury. Examples: physical fitness, body weight, blood pressure, energy levels. 
- **Social Health and Wellbeing**: Ability to form meaningful relationships, managing/adapting to social situations, communicating effectively, contributing to social groups. Examples: well-functioning network of family/friends, able to clearly communicate, able to manage/adapt to different social settings, able to develop/maintain relationships, positive contributions to social groups. 
- **Emotional Health and Wellbeing**: Ability to recognise, understand, and express emotions effectively; ability to manage and respond to emotions appropriately [conversational]. Example: recognising difference between embarrassment and anxiety. 
- **Mental Health and Wellbeing**: State of wellbeing where individual realises abilities, copes with normal life stresses, works productively, and contributes to community [conversational]. Examples: low levels of stress, high self-esteem, positive thought patterns, high levels of confidence. 
- **Spiritual Health and Wellbeing**: Relates to ideas, beliefs, values, ethics; includes hope, peace, sense of meaning/value, reflection on place in world; can relate to organised religion, higher power, prayer, morals, sense of purpose, connection, belonging. Examples: sense of belonging to a community group. 
- **Dynamic Nature**: Health and wellbeing are constantly changing. Example: changes can be positive or negative. 
- **Subjective Nature**: Health and wellbeing mean different things to different people, influenced by personal beliefs, feelings, and opinions. Example: a student vs. a parent's view of health. 
- **Benefits of Optimal Health and Wellbeing as a Resource** 
- Optimal H&W is seen as a resource. 
- **Individual Benefits**: Enables participation in activities (sporting team), maintaining healthy body weight/fitness, attend work, earn income, afford resources (healthcare, recreation, transport, education), sleep well, socialise, increased life expectancy, increased self-esteem, sense of self-fulfilment. 
- **National Benefits**: Increased productivity, higher tax revenue for government investment (infrastructure, social services, public housing, education, healthcare, social security, recreation facilities, law and order), less money spent on healthcare/welfare, increased civic participation, defence, education access, employment access, human rights, resources, reduced segregation. Example: reduction in lung cancer -> more people well enough to work -> government collects more tax. 
- **Global Benefits**: People can work together on global challenges (climate change), more likely to attend work/contribute to economy, reduced risk of disease transmission across borders, less conflict between countries as resources are more accessible. Example: reduction in measles -> more people experiencing optimal H&W globally. Example: reduced communicable diseases -> fewer deaths/symptoms -> more productive -> decreased conflict. 
- **Prerequisites for Health (WHO)** 
- Identified in the Ottawa Charter (1986). Basic conditions and resources needed for health gains. Many are interrelated. (Mnemonic suggested: People should enjoy edible food including some sustainable stew or Peace / Shelter / Equity / Education / Food / Income / Social justice / Sustainable resources / Stable ecosystem). 
- **Peace**: Absence of conflict. Promotes access to resources like water (via intact infrastructure) -> physical H&W. 
- **Shelter**: Adequate housing. Promotes physical, social, emotional, mental health by providing safety, privacy, space for relationships, security, protection from elements [conversational, supported by general HHD principles]. 
- **Education**: Gaining knowledge/skills. Increases health literacy, ability to gain meaningful employment/income, make informed health decisions, communicate, socialise. 
- **Food**: Access to sufficient, safe, nutritious food. Provides energy for physical activity/socialisation. Safe food decreases risk of foodborne diseases (WHO 2021: 600M ill, 420k die annually). Can promote social/mental H&W (sharing meals, feeling cared for). 
- **Income**: Earning money. Increases ability to afford healthcare, recreation, transport, education (individual). Increases government capacity to provide services/resources (population). Example: income used to purchase food (energy), access social activities, adequate shelter, healthcare. 
- **Stable Ecosystem**: Balance between environment and species. Provides resources like clean air/water, food; impacts climate. Example: Mountain Ash ecosystem provides water, supports species, stores carbon; threatened by fire/logging; collapse impacts economic/social aspects (water value vs timber, tourism). 
- **Sustainable Resources**: Ensuring resources for present don't compromise future needs. Relates to energy, food, water, employment, housing, healthcare. Examples: wind and solar power. 
- **Social Justice**: Equal rights for all, regardless of personal traits (sex, class, income, ethnicity, religion, age, sexual orientation). Ensures fair distribution of resources and opportunities. 
- **Equity**: Fairness, social justice with focus on disadvantaged groups; targeting those with extra needs to improve quality of life/access to resources for decent living standard. Example illustration: image contrasting equality (same height boxes) with equity (different height boxes to reach same level). 
- **Indicators Used to Measure Health Status** 
- Standard statistics to measure and compare health status. 
- **Incidence**: Number or rate of *new* cases of a condition in a given period. 
- **Prevalence**: Number or rate of *all* cases of a condition in a given period. 
- **Morbidity**: Refers to ill health in an individual or population. Often measured as incidence or prevalence. 
- **Rates of hospitalisation**. 
- **Burden of Disease**: Measure of the impact of diseases and injuries; gap between current health status and an ideal where everyone lives to old age free of disease/disability. Measured in DALY. 
- **Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY)**: Measure of burden of disease; one DALY = one year of healthy life lost due to premature death and time lived with illness/disease/injury. Calculated as DALY = YLL + YLD. 
- **Years of Life Lost (YLL)**: Fatal component of burden of disease; years of expected life lost due to premature death. 
- **Years Lived with Disability (YLD)**: Non-fatal component of burden of disease; years of healthy life lost due to living with impacts of disease/injury/disability. 
- **Life Expectancy**: Number of years person is expected to live if current death rates don't change. 
- **Health-Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE)**: Number of years person is expected to live in full health, without reduced functioning due to illness/injury. 
- **Mortality**: Refers to death, particularly at a population level. Measured by mortality rate (deaths per 100,000 population in a period). Types: maternal, infant, under five. 
- **Core activity limitation**. 
- **Psychological distress**. 
- **Self-assessed health status**: Individual's own opinion about their health and wellbeing. 
- **Data Analysis**: Embedded in study; analyse/interpret various data types (tables, graphs - bar, line, pie, infographics, quotations, case studies). Develop familiarity with measures (percentages, ratios). Tips for interpreting data: read title, axes labels/units, key, notes; look for trends, similarities, differences. Data helps identify trends, allows intervention/evaluation. 
- **Factors Contributing to Variations in Health Status** 
- Factors include biological, sociocultural, and environmental. Interplay between these factors and settings (where people born, grow, live, work, age). 
- **Biological Factors**: Relating to body structure, cells, tissues, systems function. Examples: genetics (including sex), body weight (BMI), blood pressure, blood cholesterol levels, glucose regulation, birth weight, age. Example: high body weight increases blood pressure -> heart attack/stroke risk. 
- **Sociocultural Factors**: Conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, age; social and cultural aspects. Examples: Socioeconomic status (SES - income, occupation, education), unemployment, social isolation, food security (must be sociocultural discussion), early life experiences, access to healthcare (must be sociocultural discussion), cultural backgrounds, social networks, social expectations and attitudes, cultural traditions, discrimination (racism), disability, inability to access services, family breakdown, homelessness, low income, social connections, social exclusion, peer group, family, health literacy. Example: low education/health literacy -> less understanding of health recommendations -> less likely to see GP -> heart disease caught later -> higher death rates. Example: social exclusion -> anxiety/depression. Example: commercial factors (food marketing/media) -> influenced consumption -> weight gain/obesity. 
- **Environmental Factors**: Physical surroundings where people live, work, play. Examples: geographic location, quality of air/water, workplace, housing environment, climate change. Example: poor quality housing -> exposed timber/wiring -> injuries. 
- **Contribution to Australia’s Health Status and Burden of Disease of Specific Factors/Risks**: Smoking/vaping, alcohol, high body mass index, dietary risks (under-consumption of fruit/vegetables/dairy, high intake of fat/salt/sugar, low intake of fibre/iron). Example: low fibre intake -> colorectal cancer. 

**Area of Study 2: Promoting Health in Australia** 

- **Changes to Public Health Approaches** 
- Reasons for improvements in Australia’s health status since 1900: ‘old’ public health, biomedical approach/medical technology improvements, social model of health, Ottawa Charter. Shift from infectious diseases to lifestyle diseases as leading cause of death. 
- **‘Old’ Public Health**: Focus on sanitation, hygiene, improved housing, working conditions, vaccinations, quarantine [supported by previous knowledge, mentioned in COVID-19 context]. Initiatives similar to old public health used for COVID-19 response (isolation, hygiene practices, mask use). 
- **Biomedical Approach**: Medical model focused on diagnosis, cure, treatment of disease/illness; focuses on physical/biological aspects; individualistic approach. Interventions: X-rays, medications (antibiotics, blood pressure meds), surgery (heart surgery), transplants [previous knowledge]. Strengths: advances in medical technology, effective diagnosis/treatment. Limitations: expensive, not accessible to all, doesn't address underlying causes. Important for addressing disease (e.g., COVID-19) by providing tools for diagnosis, treatment, prevention (vaccines). 
- **Social Model of Health**: Focuses on policies, education, health promotion activities; addresses broader factors (determinants) causing ill health; community focus. Strengths: addresses underlying factors, aims for prevention. Limitations: interventions may be ignored. Important for addressing disease (e.g., COVID-19) by recognising broader determinants, needing prevention, education, equity. A shift from blaming individuals to addressing broader factors [supported by previous knowledge]. (Principles of the social model are not specifically key knowledge for Unit 3 AOS 2, but the *concept* is). 
- **Relationship between Biomedical and Social Models**: Both models are needed to improve health status and reduce burden of disease [previous knowledge, 318, 365]. Example (CVD): Biomedical treats (meds, surgery), social addresses causes (prevention); both work for comprehensive care. 
- **Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion**: Framework for health promotion. Five action areas: 
- **Build Healthy Public Policy**: Policies/laws that support health. Examples: compulsory seatbelts, 0.05 BAC limit, speed limits [previous knowledge]. Introduce/implement no smoking laws in public places. 
- **Create Supportive Environments**: Creating environments that make healthy choices easier. Examples: bicycle lanes, pedestrian areas, Driver Reviver program [previous knowledge]. Road safety programs (Road to Zero). 
- **Strengthen Community Action**: Communities working together for health. Examples: CAAC (Aboriginal-run health service), Australian Transport Council working with police on roadside testing [previous knowledge]. Immunisation strategy involving multiple groups. Asthma support/prevention groups. Community engagement/messaging for COVID-19 hygiene/prevention. 
- **Develop Personal Skills**: Gaining health-related knowledge/skills. Examples: health curriculum in schools, healthy cooking classes, Quit campaign, Walk to School program [previous knowledge, 244, 610]. Care for Kids' Ears initiative providing resources/education. Aboriginal Road to Good Health (Type 2 Diabetes prevention education). COVID-19 public health messaging to promote hygiene/prevention. Quit campaign educating about smoking. Educating parents re sunscreen. 
- **Reorient Health Services**: Shifting focus from just diagnosis/treatment to prevention and health promotion; health professionals acting as educators [previous knowledge]. Doctors acting as educators, ambulance workers doing road safety sessions [previous knowledge]. Linked to concepts in Source 2. 
- **Australia’s Health System** 
- Role in promoting Australia’s health relates to funding, sustainability, equity, and access. Important to know what each part does, advantages/disadvantages, similarities/differences. 
- **Medicare**: Universal healthcare system [previous knowledge]. Funds public hospital stays, subsidises GP fees and other services. Funded by Medicare levy, Medicare levy surcharge, general taxation [previous knowledge]. Promotes access and fairness [previous knowledge]. Schedule fee is amount Medicare contributes. Covers out-of-hospital (GP fees, eye tests, diagnostic tests) and in-hospital (public hospital accommodation/treatment if medically necessary) expenses. 
- **Private Health Insurance (PHI)**: Works alongside Medicare [previous knowledge]. Covers private hospital care (potentially shorter waits), alternative medicines [previous knowledge, 607]. Increases treatment options, promotes satisfaction/self-assessed health status. 
- **Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)**: Subsidises essential medicines. Improves access by lowering costs [previous knowledge]. 
- **National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS)**: Provides support for people with permanent/significant disability under 65. Aims for ordinary life via access to mainstream services (housing, infrastructure). Promotes equity by targeting those with extra needs (assistive technology). Promotes sustainability via funding sources (increased Medicare levy surcharge). Can increase ability to work, gain sense of purpose (spiritual H&W). 
- **Health Promotion Initiatives** 
- Evaluate initiatives in terms of ability to improve health outcomes. 
- **Initiatives to Improve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples’ Health**: Analysed in relation to Ottawa Charter/social justice. Evaluation considers: education provision, stakeholder involvement, cultural appropriateness, specific needs, funding, significant health issue addressed, data. Examples: 
- **Care for Kids’ Ears initiative**: Addresses otitis media (ear infections). Provides info resources (health professionals, communities, schools), uses apps/kiosks in 22 Indigenous languages, media partnerships. Evaluation showed increased awareness/knowledge among mothers. Culturally appropriate, develops personal skills [previous knowledge]. 
- **Aboriginal Road to Good Health**: Type 2 Diabetes prevention program. Educates Indigenous people about food/lifestyles. Reflects Develop Personal Skills action area. 
- **NACCHO** (National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation): Aboriginal-run health services providing holistic, comprehensive, culturally appropriate care initiated/operated by local community [previous knowledge]. Reflects Strengthen Community Action [previous knowledge]. 
- **Initiatives to Promote Healthy Eating**: Evaluated in terms of ability to improve health outcomes. Examples of tools: 
- **Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE)**: Visual tool showing proportions of 5 food groups. 
- **Healthy Eating Pyramid**: Visual food selection tool based on dietary guidelines, easy to follow. Includes water, physical activity, reducing salt/sugar [previous knowledge]. Uses: planning meals, monitoring intake. 
- **Health Star Rating system**. 
- **Nutrition Australia**: NGO promoting healthy eating/physical activity. Work includes Healthy Eating Advisory Service, National Nutrition Week. 
- **Challenges in Bringing About Dietary Change**: Difficult to achieve in Australia. Explained by sociocultural factors, including commercial factors (marketing/promotion tactics). Example: Family/culture influencing food choices. Example: Food marketing/media (junk food ads) influencing children's consumption/obesity. Study found children eat more after watching junk food ads (extra 210-250 kj/day).
